;;; Commentary:

;; To keep track of which buffers are connected to a specific archive,
;; cpio-mode uses the idea of affiliated buffers.
;; 
;; The buffers affiliated with an archive's buffer are the following:
;; 1. The buffer holding the dired-like information.
;; 2. The buffers holding any entry's contents.
;; Killing the dired-like buffer also kills the archive's buffer,
;; and killing the archive's buffer kills
;; all remaining affiliated buffers.
;; 
;; HEREHERE (Well, that's the intent. It doesn't seem to work correctly yet.)

;;; Documentation:

;; The following incantation should run the tests well.
